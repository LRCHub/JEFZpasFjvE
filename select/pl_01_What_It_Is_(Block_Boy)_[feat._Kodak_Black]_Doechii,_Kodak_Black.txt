Every good girl

Every block boy

Can't you just see,

Panoramic view,

All about me,

Never switchin' sides,

All night, I like
You ain't gotta say it

She got everything you want
in her, a nice body, ass fat
Behind every gangster,

He know who to come

world handlin' him bad
The way he call first

And a thug need a lil'
love too, baby, how ‘bout me?
Told her,
"Don't call me Lil' Steeve
'cause I smell like money"
I put it down the greatest
babe,
but hold this here for me
I took her from her nigga,
we vibin', 'til
we 'side the country
Said she had a lil' situation
but I could
tell it ain't 'bout nothin'
I mean, I'm rappin', bitch
She said, "Don't hush me",
I said, "Don't rush me"
And I could tell how much
she like a nigga
by the way she suck me
